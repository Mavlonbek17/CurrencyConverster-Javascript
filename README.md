# This is simple Javascript andHTML CSS website app. Which runs only in your local host
This website uses the API of the fixer.io website. link = 'http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key=70e6592d57eb999ef73ffd064f0add69&format=1'
Using the fetch in Javascript I converted the response to the json file. And Using that data I built an exchange rate app wich converts the EUR to  other currencies in real time.
## How to run it:
1: Clone the repository and run html file in your local host:
2: Type any currency short names such as : PLN ,pln or USD ,usd . Both small and Big letters are the same
